# ValorantBGVideoChanger
#### Replace Valorant's main menu background video. (WIP xd)

IT'S CURRENTLY **NOT** USABLE UNLESS YOU USE AN IDE, AND IM TOO LAZY TO FIX IT

Written in Python\
Sorry you had to lay your eyes on this.. thing, lmao

## **README:**

- You need to make sure that Riot Client is already running and Valorant is updated (This is important because every time you relaunch Riot Client, it replaces your video with
the original one via "updates".)

- If you don't know how to copy the path of a video, just right-click the video and click "Copy as path".

- If you didn't change the downloading destination while downloading Riot Client, the original video file should be at "C:\Riot Games\VALORANT\live\ShooterGame\Content\Movies\Menu\HomeScreen.mp4".

- You only need to enter the paths once unless you delete "pathdatabase.txt" and "pathdatabase1.txt".
