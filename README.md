# ValorantBGVideoChanger
Replace Valorant's main menu background video. (WIP, unefficent coding so it will take some time.)

Written in Python

You need to run this script instead of launching Riot Client, it will launch the Riot Client itself. It will not work if you run Riot Client first. (Will be fixed)

Further information will be added.

Sorry you had to lay your eyes on this atrocity, lmao
